This repository contains the supplementary material for Bioinformatics Research Project 2 supplementary material conducted by student Jacob Tudor and supervised by Dr Michael Buckley, Dr Alexander Eckersley.  

Contents: 
Word documents: Analysis of PTMs across PLF identified regions of age-associated structural difference. Methods, Results and limitations included. Description of custom built tools provided. Document of mapped PTMs also provided

PTM_Graphs: Visualisations of Average total PTM abundance across statistically significant regions of age associated structural change +- 50aa data included 

.csv files: PTMs in male and female specimens across fuzzy and jumbo rats in regions identified by PLF to express age-associated differences in protein structure and the surrounding adjacent 50aa regions. 

Jupyter notebooks: Files used to build the tools and visualisations used to generate and analyse the data
